# basicAsmStatsCalcInPy
Calculate continuity statistics for a genome assembly

## Usage
`python3 calc.py input_fasta_file.fa output_stats_file.txt genome_size_in_bases`

## Disclaimer
This program is ***not*** fast. I've never bothered to implement it in another language or using a different technique. Depending on what you're looking for, much better options already exist.
